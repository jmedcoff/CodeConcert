# Code Concert: Composing live music with TidalCycles

The talk notes ([in html here](index.html)) can be found
[here](http://bit.ly/codeconcert). Slides are [here](slides/slides.pdf).

Some extra info not covered in the talk, mostly extra detail:

The SuperDirt samples folder is as described in [this
file](sampleslocation.txt). The samples here are those provided with
SuperDirt, and form a SuperCollider "package" called a quark. If you
want to grab these default samples, or add some new custom samples for
use like I have done, you can place them here, in a subfolder. Look at
some of the default samples for examples on how to structure this.

The most common issue when setting up TidalCycles is probably port
miscommunication, resulting in no connection between Tidal and
SuperCollider. Make sure your editor is actually "turned on" to
broadcast on the appropriate port, and ensure that SuperDirt has been
started in SuperCollider.
